# Social Team

Node.js as a project has responsibility and control of the management
of its official social media. It has delegated the management
of its official social media to both the Foundation Staff and
members of the Social team as a joint responsibility.
The Foundation Staff and members of the Social team as a group will be
referred to as the `joint team`.

## Responsibilities

The joint team is tasked with maintaining the project's social accounts.
This includes:

- Content creation
- Amplification of our community
  - Sharing, retweeting, and so on
- Engagement with our community
  - Liking, replying, and so on
- Updating account metadata (like bio, avatar, header images, and so on)

### Platforms 

This joint team controls and maintains the various social platforms
in which Node.js has an official presence:

- [Node.js on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nodejs)
- [Node.js on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nodejsfoundation)
- [Node.js on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/node.js-foundation/)

### Access

The joint team will have full access to all [platforms](#platforms).

### Expectations

The expectation is that the Foundation Staff will lead the day-to-day work
of engaging on the platforms and that Social Team members will act in
a supporting role. Social team members should co-operate with the
efforts of the Foundation staff and act as a supplement/supporter
of their efforts which include:

- Engaging on various platforms weekly
- Spending time working with project committees, working groups, initiatives,
  and teams to build effective outward communication as needed

### Repositories

The joint team will be responsible for and maintain the following:

- [nodejs/social-team](https://github.com/nodejs/social-team): a repo for general discussion, logging, and broad requests made of the Social Team.
- [nodejs/tweet](https://github.com/nodejs/tweet): a repo leveraging [Twitter Together](https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together) that enables project members to queue up tweets to [@nodejs](https://twitter.com/nodejs) from within GitHub.

## Membership

### Nominations

Nominations and self-nominations are open to **project members** on an ongoing basis.
An issue should be created in [nodejs/admin](https://github.com/nodejs/admin)
for any kind of nomination. Nominations require +1s from existing Social Team 
members and no objections after seven days.

### Objections

Membership in the Social Team **requires** zero objections
from [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/tsc) members and Foundation Staff.

Should there be an objection from a TSC member or Foundation staff to a nomination,
there are multiple paths to surface it:

- Directly in a nomination issue
- By requesting a peer on the TSC to proxy your objection
- Through the TSC chairperson who will proxy your objection

An objection *does* require substantiation beyond a simple `-1`, which can be commented or
otherwise passed along through an objection proxy. Since this is a role built
upon extreme trust and high impact, the substantiation is not negotiable
by either the nominee or other TSC members.

More explicitly: If an objection is stated, the nomination does not pass.

#### Re-nomination

If a nomination is objected to, the nominee can be re-nominated or
re-self-nominated after 6 months.

### Re-certification

An annual recertification vote is required for all Social Team members.
For an individual to be recertified, a simple majority vote in favor
of recertification is required by the TSC.

### Removal

A member of the Social Team may be removed by the request of any TSC member.
This request can be raised in the same way as is listed for raising an
[objection](#objection) to a nomination, in the original nomination issue.

### Membership Expectations

The joint team is expected to adhere to the
[Membership Expectations](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MemberExpectations.md) document.

Furthermore, the joint team is expected to be responsive and open to good-faith
feedback from both project and community members about their approach to
content and interactions on the platforms they maintain. Joint team members
are expected to be proactive in reacting to any good-faith feedback
received from project and community members.
