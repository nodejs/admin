# Social Team

Node.js as a project has a Social Team, a joint team between the TSC and CommComm to which the project has delegated the management of its official social media.

## Responsibilities

The Social Team is tasked with maintaining the project's social accounts. This includes:

- Content creation
- Amplification of our community
  - Sharing, retweeting, and so on
- Engagement with our community
  - Liking, replying, and so on
- Updating account metadata (like bio, avatar, header images, and so on)

With regard to posts and community interaction, there is no requirement or entitlement - rather, all posts and interactions are made and/or validated completely at the discretion of the Social Team's members.

### Platforms 

This team controls and maintains the various social platforms that Node.js has:

- [Node.js on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nodejs)
- [Node.js on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nodejsfoundation)
- [Node.js on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/node.js-foundation/)

### Access

Social Team members will have full access to all [platforms](#platforms).

### Expectations

The basic expectations are that **all** Social Team members will have both a willingness and ability to...

- Spend time weekly engaging on various platforms, or communicate the inability to do so with other social team members and work with them to ensure there is *some* coverage
- Spend time working with other social team members on building out good content
- Spend time working work project committees, working groups, initiatives, and teams to build effective outward communication as needed

### Repositories

The Social Team will be responsible for and maintain the following:

- [nodejs/tweet](http://github.com/nodejs/tweet): a repo leveraging [Twitter Together](https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together) that enables project members to queue up tweets to [@nodejs](https://twitter.com/nodejs) from within GitHub.

## Membership

### Nominations

Nominations and self-nominations are open to **project members** on a rolling basis. An issue should be created in [nodejs/admin](https://github.com/nodejs/admin) for any kind of nomination.

### Objections

Membership in the Social Team **requires** zero objections from [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/tsc) and [CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) members.

Should there be an objection from a TSC member or CommComm member to a nomination, there are multiple paths to surfacing it:

- Directly in a nomination issue
- Through requesting a peer on the TSC or CommComm proxy your objection
- Through the TSC or CommComm chairperson who will proxy your objection

An objection *does* require substantiation beyond a simple `-1`, which can be commented or otherwise passed along through an objection proxy. Since this is a role built upon extreme trust and high impact, the substantiation is not negotiable by either the nominee or other TSC or CommComm members.

More explicitly: If an objection is stated, the nomination does not pass.

#### Re-nomination

If a nomination is objected to, the nominee can be re-nominated or re-self-nominated after 6 months.

### Re-certification

An annual recertification vote is required for all Social Team members. For an individual to be recertified, a simple majority vote in favor of recertification is required by both the TSC and CommComm.

### Removal

A member of the Social team may be removed on request of any TSC or CommComm member. This request can be raised in the same way as listed for raising an [objection](#objection) to a nomination, in the original nomination issue.

### Membership Expectations

The Social Team is expected to adhere to the [Membership Expectations](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MemberExpectations.md) document.

Further, the Social Team is expected to be responsive and open to good-faith feedback from both project and community members about their approach to content and interactions on the platforms they maintain. Social Team members are expected to be proactive in reacting to good-faith feedback received from project and community members.
