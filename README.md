# Administration for TSC + Community Committee collaborative efforts
This repository is formal efforts of the Node.js project that are overseen and require input from both the [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) and [CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee).

Initiatives that are overseen here:
- [Travel Fund](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.MD)

Repositories that fall under the responsibility of the TSC and CommComm:

- This repo
- [Getting Started](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started)
- [Collaboration Summit](https://github.com/nodejs/summit)
- The private [Moderation](https://github.com/nodejs/moderation) repo (Collaborators-only access)

## Governance and Current Members

The Admin repo is overseen by the [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) and [CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) as collaborative groups. Any action requiring consensus and voting will abide by the following process.

Members of the TSC and CommComm shall operate under Lazy Consensus as a collaborative unit in the Admin repo hereby referenced as the *Admin members*. Members shall establish appropriate guidelines for implementing Lazy Consensus (e.g. expected notification and review time periods) within the development process.

The *Admin members* follow a Consensus Seeking decision making model. When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a member can call for either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the *Admin members* or else the discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all *Admin members* for, or against, the issue wins. There must be a simple majority vote in each committee. If an individual happens to be in both committees, then they would end up with two votes. An *Admin member* may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.
