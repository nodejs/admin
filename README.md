# Administration for TSC + Community Committee collaborative efforts
This repository is formal efforts of the Node.js project that are overseen and require input from both the [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) and [CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee).

Repositories that fall under the responsibility of the TSC and CommComm:

- This repo
- [Getting Started](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started)
- The private [Moderation](https://github.com/nodejs/moderation) repo (Collaborators-only access)

## Travel Fund

Each member of the Node.js organization can ask for funding to travel and spread knowledge about and support the Javascript ecosystem and the Foundation.

The management of Travel Fund for collaborators is managed by the [OpenJS
Foundation Cross-Project-Council](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/project-resources/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md).

## Collaborator Summit

Every year, Node.js collaborators meet up in one or more Collaborator
Summit. If you are interested in joining or helping with the
organization, the management of Collaborators Summit is managed by the [OpenJS
Foundation Summit team](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit).

## Governance and Current Members

The Admin repo is overseen by the [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) and [CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) as collaborative groups. Any action requiring consensus and voting will abide by the following process.

Members of the TSC and CommComm shall operate under Lazy Consensus as a collaborative unit in the Admin repo hereby referenced as the *Admin members*. Members shall establish appropriate guidelines for implementing Lazy Consensus (e.g. expected notification and review time periods) within the development process.

For all votes, the vote must pass in both TSC and CommComm or else the motion fails. If an individual happens to be in both committees, then they would end up with two votes.

All calendar maintainers have `Make changes AND manage sharing` permissions. If you would like to help maintain your team's calendar events, open a PR adding your name to the list above. Once approved, one of the calendar maintainers will add you to the calendar settings.

This list should be reviewed and pruned annually (at minimum). The calendar has a yearly recurring event on Jan 31st for this. An issue should be opened asking the calendar maintainers for their continued volunteering efforts (directly @-mention all members). After 1 week, this list should be PRed removing members that did not respond. [The calendar permissions to be updated once merged](https://support.google.com/a/answer/117596?hl=en).
