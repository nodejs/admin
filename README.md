# Administration Documents for Node.js

This repository is formal efforts of the Node.js project that are overseen by the
[TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC) regarding the less technical aspects of the project.

It is also used to discuss:

- [Getting Started](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started)
- The private [Moderation](https://github.com/nodejs/moderation) repo (Collaborators-only access)

## Travel Fund

Each member of the Node.js organization can ask for funding to travel and spread knowledge about and support the JavaScript ecosystem and the Foundation.

The management of Travel Fund for collaborators is managed by the [OpenJS
Foundation Cross-Project-Council](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/project-resources/MEMBER_TRAVEL_FUND.md).

## Collaborator Summit

Every year, Node.js collaborators meet up in one or more Collaborator
Summit. If you are interested in joining or helping with the
organization, the management of Collaborators Summit is managed by the [OpenJS
Foundation Summit team](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit).

A calendar of the project's meetings can be found at:

https://nodejs.org/calendar

<sup>Click `+GoogleCalendar` at the bottom right to add to your own Google calendar.</sup>

All calendar maintainers have `Make changes AND manage sharing` permissions. If you would like to help maintain your team's calendar events, open a PR adding your name to the list above. Once approved, one of the calendar maintainers will add you to the calendar settings.

This list should be reviewed and pruned annually (at minimum). The calendar has a yearly recurring event on Jan 31st for this. An issue should be opened asking the calendar maintainers for their continued volunteering efforts (directly @-mention all members). After 1 week, this list should be PRed removing members that did not respond. [The calendar permissions to be updated once merged](https://support.google.com/a/answer/117596?hl=en).
