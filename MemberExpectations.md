It is important that members of our leadership groups (TSC, CommComm) act
in a way that not only complies with the
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
but that supports the vision, mission and operating principles of the Node.js project.

It is understood that members will have individual opinions and will express
their individual opinions during discussions within the organization. All
contributors are expected to be respectful of these different viewpoints,
and to work collaboratively with one another in a manner that constructively
elevates all contributors.

When an individual contributor chooses to accept an invitation to participate
in a leadershp role, they implicitly take on an additional obligation to protect
and be respectful of both the project and all other contributors.  When
decisions are made within the established guidelines and policies
of the project, those in leadership roles have a responsibility to uphold
and respect the decision even if they disagree with it. This is especially
important in external communications, for example in social media. Should
the member be unwilling or unable to do so, then they should step down and
resign their leadership position. This does not mean that decisions cannot
be revisited and discussed within the team at a later time.

Members of our leadership groups must also conduct themselves in a
professional and respectful manner. Some general guidelines include:

- Remediate quickly when you realize you made a mistake. Leaders are human,
  and they will make mistakes - however they should act swiftly to
  acknowledge mistakes and correct them. Most often this can mitigate
  any damage done.
- Aim to remediate first and then discuss.  If other members of the
  team express concerns about actions, acknowledge their concerns by
  stopping the actions in question and then discuss within the team
  to come to a common agreement.
- Treat all community members with respect, consideration, and highest
  standards of ethical conduct.  
- Valuing a diversity of views and opinions. Strive to avoid preferential
  treatment, and hold everyone (including ourselves) accountable to the same
  set of standards.  Everyone gets to speak up. 
- Deal with issues directly with the person in question. Resist complaining
  about others in the project in a public sphere.
- Build trust by keeping your promises.
- Be the model of accountability and leadership. Provide the example of
  ownership and stewardship that everyone can follow to success.
- Commit to ongoing development and learning best practices for governing.
- Critique ideas rather than individuals, discussing any concerns in person
  whenever possible, and taking responsibility for our statements by
  speaking as much as possible
  in the first person (.I. statements) rather than in the third person.
  
While the guidelines above focus primarily on the spaces where
we participate in official foundation work (github, irc, conferences),
it is important to recognize that the public behavior of members also
reflects on the Node.js project.

If it appears that any member of the project leadership is acting outside
of the expectations set above please refer to our moderation policy which
outlines the process of making an official complaint.

This policy, and changes to it, are not retroactive.
