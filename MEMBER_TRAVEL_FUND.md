## Purpose

To establish and administer a fund for members of the Node.js
Foundation to travel and spread knowledge about and support the foundation
and the Node.js Foundation projects.

## Restrictions

* Candidates must be an individual member of the Node.js Foundation.

## Process

Any member can apply for travel funds. Requests must be made prior to the start
of travel. Requests submitted after travel has started will not be approved.

Review of requests will take at least 72 hours and may take considerably longer.
Approval is not guaranteed. If a request is rejected, reimbursement will not be
issued. It is strongly recommended that you submit your request far enough in
advance to get approval before making relevant expenditures.

If you need a visa for the country in which the Node.js event you are attending
is being held, see the detail instructions on [how to prepare for visa application](./travel-visas.md).

### Request

* Open a pull request which adds an entry to the table at the bottom of this
  file.
 * Include the name of the event you plan to attend.
 * Include the location of the event and where you will be traveling from.
 * Include the presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
 * Include the size of the stipend you wish to receive.
   * Reimbursement stipends are expected to vary with travel distance.
   * In the PR description, mention `@nodejs/tsc` and
     `@nodejs/community-committee`.
* Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with that
  information.

### Approval

A request is approved when all of the following criteria are met:

* The pull request has been open for at least 72 hours.
* The request has approval from at least two members of @nodejs/tsc and two
  members of @nodejs/community-committee. (People who are members of both
  committees may only be counted for one or the other. Therefore, any request
  will always require at least four approvals.)
* No members of either @nodejs/tsc or @nodejs/community-committee have objected
  to the request.
* The pull request has been merged. Any member may merge once other
  prerequisites have been met.

If a request is blocked by an objection from a member of @nodejs/tsc or
@nodejs/community-committee, then the only way for the request to be approved is
for that committee to decide to approve the request using whatever
decision-making process the  committee uses when consensus is not reached. (For
example, for the TSC, there is a voting process to make decisions when consensus
cannot be reached.)

An appointed treasurer from either the @nodejs/tsc or @nodejs/community-committee
(or both) will liaise with a member of the Node.js Foundation on a regular basis
to review the status of the travel fund. In the event that any pending requests
might not be approved because of available funds, a separate issue will be raised.
Generally speaking, however, members shouldn't need to worry about the status
of the fund itself.

**The following considerations are made for approval of the request:**

* Impact: Preference given to underserved communities. More specifically,
within a subject the foundation is trying to promote awareness about (e.g.
general knowledge about the foundation) there are people, communities, and
geographies where that knowledge is not very widespread. This is where
preference will be given. For instance, an event in San Francisco would be
less attractive than an event of the same size in Kansas City.
* Cost: The larger the stipend the more critically the travel fund admins will
consider the application. The budget for this program is a finite resource.
* Equity: Preference given to individuals who do not have a corporate travel
  fund and have not previously received a stipend.

Examples of prior travel requests include attending a TC39 meeting,
Collaborator Summit, and Code + Learn mentoring.

### Reimbursement

Once the request has been approved, you must:

1. Provide receipts as attachments in an email stating your name, the participation covered,
and the total approved for reimbursement.
2. Fill out and attach the [Expense Report](./expense-report-template.xls?raw=true).
3. Email this reimbursement request to ap@linuxfoundation.org and cc
mrhinkle@linuxfoundation.org and annmarie@thisdot.co.

Submit reports within one calendar month of the event date. Submitting reports
in a timely fashion facilitates accurate record-keeping.

Due to privacy, the Individual Members list is not public. This team will verify the
requester is on the Individual Members list before funds are disbursed. This
disbursement is generally processed within 30 days. The community manager or a
member of the Node.js Foundation team within the Linux Foundation will report
back amounts consumed from the travel allocation on a monthly basis to the
Chairs.

Once the final amount of reimbursement is known, update the table below with
that information.
