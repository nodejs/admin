## Purpose

To establish and administer a fund for members of the Node.js Foundation to travel and spread knowledge about and support Node.js 
ecosystem and the Foundation. 

### [Current Year Fund](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/TravelFunds/2019.md)

### [2018 funds](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/TravelFunds/2018.md)

## Restrictions

* Candidates must be an individual member of the Node.js Foundation. [The membership status can be checked on the foundation website](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/user/login?destination=user/me). Due to privacy, the Individual Members list is not public. 
This team will verify the requester is on the Individual Members list before funds are disbursed. 
* Those requesting funds must indicate that they do not have funding available from another source, such as an employer or 
the event itself that might cover costs for presenters. 

## Process

Requests must be made prior to the start of travel. Requests submitted once travel is complete will not be approved. 

It is strongly recommended that you submit your request far enough in advance to get approval before making relevant expenditures. 
Review of requests will take at least 72 hours and may take considerably longer. Note, with limited funds available, approval is not 
guaranteed. If a request is rejected, reimbursement will not be issued.The Foundation cannot pre-pay for travel expenditures. 

## Visa Tips

For all events, 3rd party or hosted Foundation events, it is recommended to apply for a visa at least 6 months prior to an event. 

### For Industry Events 

If you need a visa for the country in which the Node.js event you are attending is being held, 
[see the document on preparing for a visa application](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/travel-visas.md). 

### What The Foundation Can Do To Help: 

The Foundation [provides guidance on preparing your visa application](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/master/travel-visas.md), 
including information on visa processing times and a checklist of items that a visa application could require.

For Foundation-hosted events, Node.js Foundation provides a visa letter by The Linux Foundation (does not guarantee visa approval). 
Click [here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-js-interactive-2018/attend/visa-request/) to request a visa letter.

### What the Foundation Cannot Do: 

Please note that unless the Foundation is specifically hosting the event, we cannot help with visa letters. 
The Foundation is also not able to contact consulates. When the Foundation has done this in the past, our efforts have been unsuccessful 
and/or weâ€™ve lacked the expertise to be effective.  

For additional information on preparing your visa application or requesting a visa letter, please email 
[visainfo@nodejs.org](mailto:visainfo@nodejs.org).

### Requesting Travel Funds 

* Open a pull request that adds an entry to the appropriate year's file
  * Include as many fields as possible:
    * The name of the event you plan to attend.
    * The location, dates of the event and where you will be traveling from.
    * The presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
    * The size of the stipend you wish to receive.
      * Reimbursement stipends are expected to vary with travel distance.
      * In the PR description, mention @nodejs/tsc and @nodejs/community-committee.
    * Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with that information.
    * Certain details of your request (such as the column for date sent to finance) may be unknown initially; these can be filled in and updated during the process of reconciliation.

### Approval

A request is approved when all of the following criteria are met:

* The pull request has been open for at least 72 hours.
* The request has approval from at least two members of @nodejs/tsc and two members of @nodejs/community-committee. 
(People who are members of both committees may only be counted for one or the other. 
Therefore, any request will always require at least four approvals.)
* No members of either @nodejs/tsc or @nodejs/community-committee have objected to the request.
* The pull request has been merged. Any member may merge once other prerequisites have been met.

If a request is blocked by an objection from a member of @nodejs/tsc or @nodejs/community-committee, then the only way for the request 
to be approved is for that committee to decide to approve the request using whatever decision-making process the committee uses when 
consensus is not reached. (For example, for the TSC, there is a voting process to make decisions when consensus cannot be reached.)

An appointed treasurer from either the @nodejs/tsc or @nodejs/community-committee (or both) will liaise with a member of 
the Node.js Foundation on a regular basis to review the status of the travel fund. In the event that any pending 
requests might not be approved because of available funds, a separate issue will be raised. Generally speaking, however, 
members shouldn't need to worry about the status of the fund itself.

As examples, the purpose of prior sponsored travels includes attending TC39 meetings, 
attending [Node.js collaboration summits](https://github.com/nodejs/summit), and 
mentoring [Code and Learn](https://github.com/nodejs/code-and-learn).

#### Considerations for approval of a request

##### Impact
* Preference is given to events hosted or sponsored by the Node.js Foundation. For example, 
Node.js collaboration summits and Diagnostics summits should be given precedence because they bring together members of the 
Foundation to help the Foundation projects advance. 
* Preference is given to speakers and panelists of a conference. Speaking and doing panels at a conference generates a more 
significant impact than attending. However, individuals applying for the travel fund to speak or participate in panels should confirm 
that the event organizers cannot cover the travel expenses before submitting a request.

##### Outreach
* Preference is given to underserved communities. More specifically, within a subject the foundation is trying to promote awareness 
about (e.g. general knowledge about the foundation) there are people, communities, and geographies where that knowledge is not very 
widespread. This is where preference will be given. For instance, an event in San Francisco would be less attractive than an event of 
the same size in Kansas City.

##### Cost
* The larger the stipend the more critically the travel fund admins will consider the request and application. 
The budget for this program is a finite resource.

##### Equity
* Preference is given to individuals who cannot receive travel funding from their employers or individuals who have not 
previously received a stipend.

### Reimbursement

Once the request has been approved, you must:


1. Provide receipts as attachments in an email stating your name, the participation covered,
and the total approved for reimbursement.
2. Fill out and attach the [Expense Report](./expense-report-template.xls?raw=true) and rename as ExpenseReport-Node-EVENTNAME-YOURNAME-YYYYMM.
3. Sign the form, date the form, and return it as a PDF. The sign line can be found in the lower left hand corner of the above document. The individual tasked with approving the expense will countersign before sending for processing. You may use an e-signature such as docusign or [the 'markup' feature in Preview](https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/fill-out-and-sign-pdf-forms-prvw35725/mac).

4. Expense reports must be submitted within 30 days of event date. Any reports submitted 
   after 30 days may not be reimbursed.
5. Disbursements are generally processed within 30 days. 

Due to privacy, the Individual Members list is not public. This team will verify the
requester is on the Individual Members list before funds are disbursed. The community
manager or a member of the Node.js Foundation team within the Linux Foundation will report 
back amounts consumed from the travel allocation on a monthly basis to the Chairs.

* Provide receipts as attachments in an email stating your name, the event covered, and the total approved for reimbursement.
* Fill out and attach the [Expense Report](./expense-report-template.xls?raw=true) and rename as ExpenseReport-Node-YOURNAME-YYYYMM.
* Email this reimbursement request to travelapprovals@nodejs.org.
* Expense reports must be submitted within 30 days of event date. Any reports submitted after 30 days may not be reimbursed.
* Disbursements are generally processed within 30 days.
* Note: We are unable to pre-pay for expenses. 


A member of the Node.js Foundation team within the Linux Foundation will report monthly on travel funds allocated to the Chairs.
