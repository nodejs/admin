## Purpose

To establish and administer a fund for members of the Node.js
Foundation to travel and spread knowledge about and support the foundation
and the Node.js Foundation projects.

## Restrictions

* Candidates must be an individual member of the Node.js Foundation.

## Process

Any member can apply for travel funds. Each request may take up to a month
for the [Admin members](https://github.com/nodejs/admin#governance-and-current-members)
to approve or decline.

### Request
* Open a pull request against this repository which adds an entry to the table at the bottom of this file.
 * Include the name of the event you plan to attend.
 * Include the location of the event and where you will be traveling from.
 * Include the presentation you intend to give, if applicable.
 * Include the size of the stipend you wish to receive.
  * Reimbursement stipends are expected to vary with travel distance.
  * In the PR description, tag the group relevant to the request: @nodejs/tsc or @nodejs/community-committee.  
  If unsure, just pick one, and that group will tag with the other group if they believe it is more appropriate.
* Once the final amount spent is known, update the table again with that information.

### Reimbursement

Once the request has been approved, provide receipts as attachments in an email stating your name, the participation covered, and the total approved for reimbursement. Send to ap@linuxfoundation.org and cc mrhinkle@linuxfoundation.org with subject `Node.js Member Travel Fund`. Due to privacy, the Individual Members list is not public. This team will verify the requester is on the Individual Members list before funds are dispersed. This dispersement is generally processed within 30 days. The community manager or a member of the Node.js Foundation team within the Linux Foundation will report back amounts consumed from the travel allocation on a monthly basis to the Chairs.

**The following considerations are made for approval of the request:**

* Impact: Preference given to underserved communities. More specifically,
within a subject the foundation is trying to promote awareness about (e.g.
general knowledge about the foundation) there are people, communities and
geographies where that knowledge is not very widespread. This is where
preference will be given. For instance, an event in San Francisco would be
less attractive than an event of the same size in Kansas City.
* Cost: The larger the stipend the more critically the travel fund admins will
consider the application. Budget for this program is a finite resource.
* Equity: Preference given to individuals who do not have a corporate travel fund and have
not previously received a stipend.

Examples of prior travel requests include attending a TC39 meeting, Collaborators
Summit, and Code + Learn mentoring.
