# Supporters

The work of the Node.js project is driven forward by volunteers. Our preferred form of support
from an organization is sending your people to contribute on a regular and consistent manner.

However, there is some supporting work within the project that is not the best fit for volunteers.
For example, when vulnerabilities come with a disclosure deadline there is no guarrantee that
a volunteers will have time to get the vulnerabilty fixed and out in a security release out in time.

In addition, the project needs non-people resources to continue operating. For example machines for
the CI infrastructure. While the OpenJS Foundation covers some resources which are needed by the
project it cannot cover all of them.

For cases were volunteers are not a great fit and for non-people resources we are grateful to the
sponsors listed on their page for their support.

## CI stability lead

The project has been having ongoing issues with flaky tests and this has been a major pain point.
The project, therefore, has a goal to hire a short term ci stability lead who can improve
ci stability and implement tooling and processes that will provide longer term benefits. The following
sponsors have made this possible:
