# Sponsorship

The Node.js project needs a variety of sponsors in order to make the delivery
of Node.js possible. Sponsors support the project through people time,
infrastructure and  monetary donations. 

## Sponsor Recognition

The project aims to recognize sponsors who help keep the `lights on` by
contributing in ways that support

* Releases 
* CI stability
* Security
* Infrastructure

In addition the project aims to recognize sponsors who make significant
individual or organizational monetary donations which are not directed
towards a specific purpose.
The project has enabled crowd funding platforms and can also receive
funds through directed contributions to the OpenJS foundation and from
OpenJS programs like the [Ecosystem Sustainability Program][].

Sponsors who have made a contribution of 5000 us or more will be
included in a rotating set of sponsors on the main Nodejs.org landing
page with a visibility in proportion to the level of
contribution that they have made.

All sponsorships are considered as being a calendar year sponsorship
with the calendar year starting on the date the donation was made.

## Releases

Organizations or individuals who commit to do at least 4 releases per
year are included in the `Releasers` section of the sponsor page on the
Node.js website.  

All of the logos shown in the `Releasers` section will be of the same
general size.

If you are a releaser or an organization who employs a releaser
See the [Releasers sponsor agreement](releasers_sponsor_agreement.md)
for how to be included in the releasers supporters. 

## CI stability

The project documented the need for a stability lead as part of
enabling crowd funding accounts. Organizations or individuals
that become supporters of 10000 US or higher towards the 60,000 US
goal will be included in the `CI Stability Lead` section of the
sponsors page.

Logos shown in the `CI Stability lead` section will be in proportion
to the percentage of the taget sponsored. For example, if a single
sponsor provides 60,000 US their logo will be the only one in that section.

the project's crowd funding accounts or through directed donation
